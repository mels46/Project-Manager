Project Manager is a project developed in Node.js, MongoDB, and EJS. It is used for tracking work processes on projects. The roles in the system are as follows:

System Administrator:

System administrators are the primary control point in the system.
They can add new projects to the system and assign them to employees.
Monitor all activities in the system through the admin panel.
Have the ability to add new users to the system, edit their data, and delete user accounts.

Project Managers:

Project managers are employees responsible for managing individual projects.
They can create new projects with details such as name, description, start, and end dates.
Assign other workers to projects and track project progress.
Have insight into the hours worked on projects.
Have insight into all tasks existing in the project.
Have insight into task statuses and various reports.
Can manage multiple projects.

Workers:

Workers are registered users of the system. Workers work on projects but can also manage projects (i.e., sometimes a worker and a project manager can be the same person).
Have access to projects they work on and can enter information about hours worked on that project.
Enter data based on tasks, so when entering data, they must select the client, project, and task.
Communicate with their superiors and colleagues through the system, exchanging information and asking questions.
